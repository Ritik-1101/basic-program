# Basic Python Programs

This repository contains 15 basic Python programs that demonstrate key programming activities. These programs cover file operations, data manipulation, functions, classes, list comprehensions, dictionaries, tuples, sets, exception handling, loops, GUI applications, web scraping, data visualization, JSON handling, and sending emails.

## Programs

### 1. Reading from and Writing to a File
This program reads content from `input.txt`, converts it to uppercase, and writes it to `output.txt`.

### 2. Basic Data Manipulation
This program performs basic data manipulation on a list of numbers: it calculates the sum, average, and maximum.

### 3. Simple Function Demonstration
This program defines a function that calculates the factorial of a number.

### 4. Simple Class Demonstration
This program defines a `Dog` class and creates objects to demonstrate its usage.

### 5. List Comprehension
This program demonstrates list comprehension by creating a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.

### 6. Dictionary Operations
This program demonstrates basic dictionary operations such as adding, updating, and deleting key-value pairs.

### 7. Working with Tuples
This program demonstrates working with tuples by creating a tuple and accessing its elements.

### 8. Set Operations
This program demonstrates basic set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

### 9. Handling Exceptions
This program demonstrates exception handling by attempting to divide by zero and catching the resulting `ZeroDivisionError`.

### 10. Using Loops
This program demonstrates the usage of `for` and `while` loops.

### 11. Simple GUI Application using Tkinter
This program creates a simple GUI application with a button that updates a label when clicked.

### 12. Basic Web Scraping
This program demonstrates basic web scraping by fetching and printing the title of a webpage.

### 13. Basic Data Visualization
This program demonstrates basic data visualization by plotting a simple graph using Matplotlib.

### 14. Reading and Writing JSON
This program demonstrates reading from and writing to a JSON file.

### 15. Sending an Email
This program demonstrates sending an email using the `smtplib` library.
